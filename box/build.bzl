    A release names its root box, so a box without `resolver_box` resolves through the root box of its
    release. A `root` box has none: it bootstraps by extracting its transaction, which is how the root
    box of a release is built in the first place. The release depends on its root box, so a root box
    takes the release's `repository_universe` as well as `release`, which its locks resolve with.

    A box with a `parent` adds its own `packages` on top of that box's. Both must use the same
    package system. When both are installed from the same repositories, the box is a layer over
    its parent unless `layered = False`; see "Box layers" in docs/design/architecture.md.

    `architectures` are the ones this box keeps a committed lock for: it is built for the host's
    alone, but refresh-catalog writes a lock per architecture, so a build on any of them has one to
    start from. A box that names none resolves during the build instead, which a root box cannot do.
    A box with a `parent` can only keep a lock for an architecture that its parent keeps one for.

    The box is configured for the host and the distribution of its release, so a
    `distribution.select()` in `packages` picks the entry of the release, or else of its family.
    `distro` names the distribution target, by default the one beside `release`.

    A box whose `release` is a `select()` on the distribution is configured for the distribution of
    the target that depends on it. A target without a distribution, such as an `exec_dep`, gets the
    catalog's default distribution. Such a box keeps no locks.
