"""What a build publishes, under the names it publishes them as.

A published name is a contract with whatever consumes the build: systemd-sysupdate matches its
transfer sources against them, so the name carries the image identity, the version, and, for a
partition, the type and UUID repart gave it. Each rule names what it produces, and a rule that
gathers artifacts from several targets reads those names here rather than composing any of its own.
The release's own description is the only name it adds.

A partition is the exception: its name exists only once repart has run, so it travels as the typed
result of the run rather than as a name, and whatever materializes it reads the name back out of
the metadata written beside it. That is the whole reason `image_artifacts` assembles its directory
from a dynamic action: everything else in it is known while the graph is still being built.

The release also carries `artifacts_<arch>.json`, which describes each published file (see
docs/user/images.md), so a consumer can read roles rather than match on a naming scheme.
