"""Signing credentials, and the ways an image can obtain them.

A private key and its certificate are one credential, so a signing role takes one key. Every producer
hands the signing tools a `SigningKeyInfo`, which is all a call site needs to know about a key. Material
in the build graph makes signing a function of declared inputs, and therefore cacheable; an external
PKCS#11 key (https://p11-glue.github.io/p11-glue/p11-kit/manual/remoting.html) does not.
