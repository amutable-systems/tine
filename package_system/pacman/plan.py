"""Resolve package transactions against pinned repository databases.

libalpm does the resolving, bound directly in `alpm.py`. It is the same library that will
apply the transaction, so plan and install cannot disagree about which package provides a
capability or which version is newer, and none of those semantics are reimplemented here.

What this driver owns is the frame around it: the pinned databases are staged where alpm looks
for them, in the order that gives repository priority its meaning, the layer stack below becomes
the root the solve resolves against, and each resolved package becomes a transaction entry named
by the content checksum its repository published. Nothing is fetched and only the throwaway root
staged below is written to, so a solve is a pure function of the pins.
