The same driver bootstraps boxes, assembles buildroots, and extends image layers. pacman
applies the transaction, so hooks and install scriptlets run as they would on a real system;
the planner has already chosen the exact set, and pacman refuses it if it is not closed.

It then normalizes the bookkeeping that would otherwise make two identical installs differ.
