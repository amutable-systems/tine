    The keyring is built from the declared keys, any others are refused. None for a repository without
    declared keys. A system whose verify program reads key files as they are has no keyring driver, and
    is handed the declared ones.

    A `box` given as a dependency builds the keyring in an anonymous target, which every consumer that
    verifies with the same box and keys shares. Only the bootstrap root of a root box is no target and
    passes a BoxInfo. `keyrings` then caches the keyrings that the caller built so far, so repositories
    declaring the same keys share one keyring instead of declaring the same output twice.

    `pinned_at` is when the repository's snapshot was published: signatures are judged as of then,
    so a pinned snapshot verifies the same way however long after it is built.
