"""Declaring a distribution, and pointing a target at one.

A distribution is one value of the `tine//distribution:distribution` constraint, the value of its
`tine//distribution:family` constraint, and the incoming transition that sets the two constraints.
The catalog declares one distribution per release in its root package, so the release name
`fedora.rawhide` names the label `catalog//:fedora.rawhide.distribution`.

The transition sets the constraint only where nothing has set it yet. The target being built is
therefore the one that decides, and every image below it, `parent` chain included, follows: a base
layer is not a distribution, it is whatever the leaf pulling it in is. For an architecture the
distribution does not serve, the transition leaves the constraint unset.
